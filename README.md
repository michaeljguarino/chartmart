## ‚ú® Features

Plural will deploy open-source applications and proprietary services on Kubernetes in your cloud using common standards like Helm and Terraform.

The Plural platform provides the following:

* Fleet-Scale GitOps Engine to deploy any helm/kustomize or yaml based service into your fleet, securely and seamlessly scalable.
* Full visibility of your fleet and all deployed services via our secure Auth Proxy.
* Kubernetes CRD-native Infrastructure As Code Management, supporting Terraform, Ansible and Pulumi, to allow you to scale usage of best practices tools without labor intensive CI/CD and branching strategies.  Get the scaling promise of Crossplane with the configuration language of terraform.
* Automated Pull Request Generation to provide full ui-based self-service while still maintaining the rigor and auditability of GitOps
* 360 Degree AI Integration, leveraging the fully integrated, all-in-one Plural platform to generate uniquely accurate AI insights into the state of your fleet and how to fix inevitable misconfigurations that might have arisen. 

In addition, the Plural api also provides:
* A DNS service to register fully-qualified domains under onplural.sh to eliminate the hassle of DNS registration for users.
* Being an OIDC provider to enable zero touch login security for all deployed Plural Console applications or any other application managed by it.

We think it's pretty cool! üòé Some other nice things:

## ‚ú® 360-degree AI Powered Insights

Use Plural's accumulated knowledge of the state of your infrastructure from metadata gathered from GitOps deployments, IaC management and the Kubernetes API's rich REST API to give AI insights that actually work.  We'll know what's going on, and let AI explain it back to you in accessible natural language, in an automated way so your devops engineers don't have to.  This includes:

* provide natural language explanations why any service or terraform stack is currently failing
* provide suggested code changes using context from the GitOps manifests associated with any failing service
* explain any kubernetes or terraform UI page to blunt the sharp edges of the Platform Engineering learning curve

### üîì Secure by default
Plural is fully self-hosted within your own environment, meaning we don't touch your credentials or sensitive information. 

Cluster setup includes deploying our Plural deployment operator, which efficiently polls the control plane for any changes that need to be applied. This ensures that our control plane doesn‚Äôt reach into these workload clusters, providing a more secure setup than push-based models and removing the need for credentials to be centralized in a single major attack-vector.

All Plural deployments are also fully customizable with our centralized secrets management. Additionally, we natively support deploying to brand new clusters or adopting existing K8s clusters.
